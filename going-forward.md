# Going Forward: Features to Look Forward To

The following is a list of major features that are expected prior to version 1.0:

1. **Dynamic command configuration.** Will allow setting of sensitive values like tokens or passwords for commands. (Priority: very high)
1. **Remote bundles.** The ability to install bundles that are defined in remote repositories. (Priority: high)
1. **Kubernetes support.** The ability to spawn workers using the K8S API instead of requiring a Docker port (Priority: medium-high)
3. **Templates.** Will allow custom output formatting to make things pretty. (Priority: medium)
4. **Support for other chat platforms.** Which ones though? (Priority: unknown)
5. **Command relays.** Will allow commands to be executed anywhere where a relay process is running. (Priority: low)
6. **Support for contemporary Slack bot accounts.** The Slack relay code was written back before legacy bots were legacy. We'll fix that. (Priority: medium/high)
