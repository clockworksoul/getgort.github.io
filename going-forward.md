The following is a list of major features that are expected prior to version 1.0

1. **Dynamic command configuration.** Will allow setting of sensitive values like tokens or passwords for commands.
1. **Command relays.** Will allow commands to be executed anywhere where a relay process is running.
1. **Templates.** Will allow custom output formatting to make things pretty.
1. **Support for other chat platforms?**
